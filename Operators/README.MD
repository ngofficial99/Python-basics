### 1. Arithmetic Operators

**File:** `arithmetic_operators.py`

Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

**Example:**
```python
# arithmetic_operators.py

a = 10
b = 5

print("Addition:", a + b)         # Output: 15
print("Subtraction:", a - b)      # Output: 5
print("Multiplication:", a * b)   # Output: 50
print("Division:", a / b)         # Output: 2.0
print("Modulus:", a % b)          # Output: 0
print("Exponentiation:", a ** b)  # Output: 100000
print("Floor Division:", a // b)  # Output: 2
