# a = 10: This line assigns the value 10 to the variable a.
# print("Initial value:", a): This line prints the initial value of a, which is 10.
a = 10
print("Initial value:", a)  # Output: 10

# a += 5: This line adds 5 to the current value of a and assigns the result back to a. It is equivalent to a = a + 5.
# print("After a += 5:", a): This line prints the new value of a, which is 15.
a += 5
print("After a += 5:", a)  # Output: 15

# a -= 3: This line subtracts 3 from the current value of a and assigns the result back to a. It is equivalent to a = a - 3.
# print("After a -= 3:", a): This line prints the new value of a, which is 12.
a -= 3
print("After a -= 3:", a)  # Output: 12

# *a = 2: This line multiplies the current value of a by 2 and assigns the result back to a. It is equivalent to a = a * 2.
# print("After a *= 2:", a): This line prints the new value of a, which is 24.
a *= 2
print("After a *= 2:", a)  # Output: 24

# a /= 4: This line divides the current value of a by 4 and assigns the result back to a. It is equivalent to a = a / 4.
# print("After a /= 4:", a): This line prints the new value of a, which is 6.0.
a /= 4
print("After a /= 4:", a)  # Output: 6.0
