## Introduction

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language. Understanding variables and data types is essential for any programmer. In this repository, you'll find explanations, examples, and a challenge to test your knowledge.

## Variables

A variable in Python is a symbolic name that references or points to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, you can refer to the object by that name.

### Variable Assignment

```python
# Assigning an integer to a variable
age = 25

# Assigning a string to a variable
name = "John"

# Assigning a float to a variable
height = 5.9

# Assigning a boolean to a variable
is_student = True
```

### Rules for Naming Variables

1. Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
2. The rest of the name must consist of letters, numbers, or underscores.
3. Variable names are case-sensitive (e.g., `age` and `Age` are different variables).

## Data Types

Python supports various data types, each serving a different purpose. Here are some of the most common data types:

### 1. Numbers

- **Integer**: Whole numbers, e.g., `10`, `-5`
- **Float**: Numbers with decimal points, e.g., `3.14`, `-2.5`

### 2. Strings

- **String**: A sequence of characters, e.g., `"hello"`, `'world'`

### 3. Booleans

- **Boolean**: Represents `True` or `False`

### 4. Lists

- **List**: An ordered collection of items, e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`, `['a', 'b', 'c']`

### 5. Tuples

- **Tuple**: An ordered, immutable collection of items, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, `('a', 'b', 'c')`

### 6. Dictionaries

- **Dictionary**: A collection of key-value pairs, e.g., `{'name': 'John', 'age': 25}`

## Examples

Here are some examples demonstrating the use of variables and data types:

```python
# Integer
age = 25
print(age)

# Float
height = 5.9
print(height)

# String
name = "John"
print(name)

# Boolean
is_student = True
print(is_student)

# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)

# Tuple
coordinates = (10.0, 20.0)
print(coordinates)

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "John", "age": 25}
print(person)
```

## Challenge

Create a Python script that does the following:

1. Defines variables for your name, age, and whether you are a student.
2. Creates a list of your favorite hobbies.
3. Creates a dictionary containing information about you (e.g., name, age, hobbies, student status).
4. Prints each piece of information on a new line.

### Example Output

```
Name: John
Age: 25
Is Student: True
Hobbies: ['Reading', 'Swimming', 'Coding']
```
