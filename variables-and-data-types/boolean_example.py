Boolean Example in Python

In Python, the Boolean data type represents one of two values: True or False. Booleans are used to evaluate conditions and make decisions in your code. They are fundamental to control flow and logical operations.

This script demonstrates various operations and methods related to Boolean values. We'll explore:
1. Creating and using Boolean variables.
2. Logical operations using Boolean values.
3. Comparison operations that result in Boolean values.
4. Boolean conversion from other data types.

One thing to make sure that True and False are reserved keywords and will only work when you write it with a Capital T and Capital F

Let's dive into some examples to understand how Boolean values work and how they can be utilized in different scenarios.

is_present = True 
is_Absent = False

print("Is Nishant Present in the office: ", is_present)
print("Was Nishant Absent yesterday: ", is_Absent)
