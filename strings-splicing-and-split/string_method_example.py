String Methods Example in Python

In this script, we will explore various string methods using Python. String methods allow you to manipulate and analyze text data in different ways. We will:

1. Get user input for name and phone number.
2. Use string methods to analyze and modify the input.
3. Print the results of these operations.

The following string methods will be demonstrated:
- len(): Get the length of the string.
- find(): Find the index of a substring.
- capitalize(): Capitalize the first character of the string.
- upper(): Convert the string to uppercase.
- lower(): Convert the string to lowercase.
- isdigit(): Check if the string consists of digits only.
- isalpha(): Check if the string consists of alphabetic characters only.
- count(): Count occurrences of a substring.
- replace(): Replace parts of the string with another substring.
