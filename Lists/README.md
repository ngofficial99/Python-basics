# Lists in Python

Lists are one of the most versatile and commonly used data structures in Python. They allow you to store multiple items in a single variable. Lists are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values. This directory contains various Python scripts that demonstrate different operations and methods you can use with lists.

## list_basics.py

This file covers the basic operations you can perform with lists, including:
- Creating lists
- Accessing elements
- Modifying elements
- Adding elements
- Removing elements

## list_methods.py

This file demonstrates various built-in list methods, such as:
- `append()`: Adds an element at the end of the list.
- `extend()`: Adds elements from another list to the end of the current list.
- `insert()`: Inserts an element at a specified position.
- `remove()`: Removes the first item with the specified value.
- `pop()`: Removes the element at the specified position.
- `clear()`: Removes all the elements from the list.
- `index()`: Returns the index of the first item with the specified value.
- `count()`: Returns the number of elements with the specified value.
- `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.
- `copy()`: Returns a copy of the list.

## list_comprehensions.py

This file explains the concept of list comprehensions, which provide a concise way to create lists. It includes:
- Basic list comprehensions
- Using conditions in list comprehensions
- Nested list comprehensions

## nested_lists.py

This file deals with nested lists (lists within lists), covering:
- Creating nested lists
- Accessing elements in nested lists
- Iterating through nested lists

## list_challenge_1.py

### Challenge 1: 
Write a program to find the second largest number in a list.

## list_challenge_2.py

### Challenge 2: 
Create a program that flattens a nested list.

## list_challenge_3.py

### Challenge 3:
Create a program that merges two lists into a dictionary, using one list for keys and the other for values.
