# Conditions in Python

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Python provides several types of conditional statements, such as `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### The `if` Statement
The `if` statement is used to test a condition. If the condition is true, the code block following the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is false, the code block is skipped.

### The `else` Statement
The `else` statement is used in conjunction with the `if` statement. It defines a block of code that executes if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

### The `elif` Statement
The `elif` statement stands for "else if" and allows you to check multiple conditions. If the initial `if` statement is false, Python checks the conditions in the `elif` statements sequentially until one is true or the `else` block is reached.

### Logical Operators
Logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` are often used with conditional statements to combine multiple conditions.

### Nested Conditions
Conditional statements can be nested within each other to create more complex decision-making structures.
