# Create a Python program that asks the user to input the current temperature in Celsius. The program should then determine if the temperature is cold, warm, or hot based on the following conditions:

# If the temperature is below 10째C, print "It's cold outside."
# If the temperature is between 10째C and 25째C (inclusive), print "It's warm outside."
# If the temperature is above 25째C, print "It's hot outside."


# Solution:

# Challenge 1: Temperature Check

# Get the current temperature from the user
temperature = float(input("Enter the current temperature in Celsius: "))

# Determine if the temperature is cold, warm, or hot
if temperature < 10:
    print("It's cold outside.")
elif 10 <= temperature <= 25:
    print("It's warm outside.")
else:
    print("It's hot outside.")
