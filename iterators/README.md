# Iterators in Python

In Python, iterators are often used with loops to iterate through sequences such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, and other iterable objects. This folder contains examples and explanations of different types of loops and their usage in Python.

## Theory

### Types of Loops

1. **`for` Loop**:
   - Used to iterate over elements of a sequence (e.g., list, tuple, dictionary).
   - Executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.

2. **`while` Loop**:
   - Repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
   - Useful when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.

### Common Loop Constructs

- **`break` Statement**: Exits the loop prematurely when a condition is met.
- **`continue` Statement**: Skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration.
- **`else` Clause**: Can be used with loops to execute a block of code once when the loop completes normally (without encountering a `break`).
